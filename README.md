# TODO List Web Application

This is a simple web application that allows users to create a to-do list with titles and descriptions. It is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and utilizes the Bootstrap library for styling.

## Usage

To use the application, simply open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser. You will see a navigation bar at the top of the screen, with a "To-Do List" link that will take you to the main page.

On the main page, you can enter a title and description for a new to-do item, and click the "Add to List" button to add it to the list. To clear the entire list, simply click the "Clear list" button.

The list itself will be displayed below the input fields, with each item numbered sequentially. Each item will display its title and description, as well as an "Edit" button and a "Delete" button. Clicking the "Edit" button will allow you to edit the item's title and description, while clicking the "Delete" button will remove the item from the list.
